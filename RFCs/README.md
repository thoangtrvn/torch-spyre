This directory contains RFCs (Request For Comments) for torch-spyre.

We use the PyTorch RFC template, since many of these RFCs will end up as
proposals to [PyTorch's upstream RFC repository](https://github.com/pytorch/rfcs).

To create a new RFC, first [open an issue](https://github.com/torch-spyre/torch-spyre/issues).
Next copy the [template directory](./NNNN-template) replacing `NNNN` with the issue number,
complete the template RFC as a markdown file, and then submit your RFC as a pull request.
