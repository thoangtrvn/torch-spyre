# Requirement files

These requirements files are autogenerated from the [pyproject.toml](../pyproject.toml) for convenience.
They are used for managing caches in CI and for the convenience of users.

- [dev.txt](dev.txt): everything required to lint, build, run, and test
- [build.txt](test.txt): everything required to lint, build, and run
- [lint.txt](lint.txt): everything required to lint
- [run.txt](run.txt): everything required to run

To refresh the requirement files, please run the [`update-requirements.sh`](../tools/update-requirements.sh) script from this folder (requires `uv`).

One of the pre-commit checks verifies if the requirement files are up to date, using the [`check-requirements.sh`](../tools/check-requirements.sh) script.

When it fails, it means that the `pyproject.toml` file was modified, and the `update-requirements.sh` was not executed.

## Updating Dependencies

If a new version of a dependency is required:

- Update the version in the `pyproject.toml` file
- Run the `update-requirements.sh` script

If a new dependency is required or if a transitive dependency needs to be updated:

- Add the new dependencies to the `pyproject.toml` file, pinned to a specific version
- Run the `update-requirements.sh` script
